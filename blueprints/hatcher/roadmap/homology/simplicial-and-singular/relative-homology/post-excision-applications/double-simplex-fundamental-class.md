# The double-simplex difference generates reduced homology

Lift `doubleSimplexFundamentalCycle R n` to a named class morphism

`R ⟶ H̃_n(doubleSimplex n;R)`

and prove that this exact morphism is an isomorphism. The main artifacts are
`Hatcher.Simplex.doubleSimplexFundamentalClass` and
`Hatcher.Simplex.doubleSimplexFundamentalClass_isIso`.

Use the reduced-to-relative comparison for the pair consisting of the double
simplex and its contractible second summand, followed by the canonical
relative comparison from the first simplex. Prove at chain level that the
difference cycle maps to the identity simplex: the second summand vanishes in
the relative quotient and the first remains. The integral specialization
therefore says that `Δ₁^n - Δ₂^n`, with the common vertex ordering, is a
generator rather than merely that the group is abstractly cyclic.
